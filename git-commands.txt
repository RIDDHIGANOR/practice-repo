 git init - initializes repo
 git status - untracked and after init and before adding to git / vcs it will still remain in file system
 git add testing.py - now after adding it will go to staged state and still it is untracked
 git rm --cached testing.py - now we can take it back to file system by using this command
 git commit -m "Added file" - and after adding we need to commit it to git now its tracked file file git
 rm testing.py - so now even though deleting it from file system we can restore it back from git
 git status 
 git restore testing.py
 ls
 git status


 Now create github account and create new repositiry to it 
 Now as we have created folder and initializes it to empty repo, in github we dont need to intitialize it.
Now we have to push our locally present code to github repo but for that we need access so we will create and use personal 
access tocken ie PAT and we will give access to github repo

But before that we will add that remote repo to local one  - git remote add origin https://github.com/RIDDHIGANOR/github-for-devops.git
 To check repo added or not - git remote -v

Yu just need to remote add origin for once to single project 
and then just set url for newly added repo for same project

and add token to it

I am doing changes through github
